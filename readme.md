# Daily Challenges
Similar to my other repo, this focuses on daily programming challenges using TDD.

### Usage

```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn
```

Run the above command to install the proper dependencies
to use the test runner for each challenge

```
npm run dev
```

Use the above command to have a webpack server constantly reload your code.
Sourcemaps are included, so debugging is possible in browser by navigating to the webpack:// section

```
npm t
```

If you'd prefer a terminal based experience, just use the above command.
